Practical project for the agile web development lecture [CITS5505](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/index.php?fname=projects&project=yes)


# Main Idea:
Ideas can be submitted by users and voted on by any other users

# Concept
Users login and will be presented by a dashboard showing them their submitted ideas and their scores. They have the option to submit new ideas, edit the idea to a new revision or delete their idea.
Users can also change their view to a stack of submitted ideas and vote on them. Ideas could be revealed depending on tags or categories or at random. Users not logged in can see all ideas but can not vote.
